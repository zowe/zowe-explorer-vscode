## Build Locally

Ensure that you meet the [software requirements](#requirements) before you build and test your Zowe Explorer.

Clone the repository, build a VSIX file, and start working with the extension.

1. Clone the repository by issuing the following command in your local command-line interface:

   ```shell
   git clone --origin=upstream --branch=master --single-branch https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe.git
   ```

2. Change directories into the newly-cloned repository:

   ```shell
   cd vscode-extension-for-zowe
   ```

3. From your local copy of the repository, issue the following commands:

   ```

You can find the VSIX file in the `dist` folder.

Now install the extension to VS Code.
