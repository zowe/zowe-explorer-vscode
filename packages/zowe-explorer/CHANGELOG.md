See the [FileSystemProvider wiki page](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/wiki/FileSystemProvider) for more information on Zowe resources.
  - `addFileSystemEvent` function to the `ZoweExplorerApiRegister` class to allow extenders to register their FileSystemProvider `onDidChangeFile` events.

- Implemented the VS Code FileSystemProvider for the Data Sets, Jobs, and USS trees to handle all read/write actions as well as conflict resolution. [#2207](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/issues/2207)
