## Introduction

[Zowe Explorer](https://github.com/zowe/community#zowe-explorer) is a sub-project of Zowe, focusing on modernizing the mainframe experience. [Zowe](https://www.zowe.org/) is a project hosted by the [Open Mainframe Project](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/), a [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) project.

The Zowe Explorer extension modernizes the way developers and system administrators interact with z/OS mainframes by:

- Enabling the ability to create, modify, rename, copy, and upload data sets directly to a z/OS mainframe.
- Enabling the ability to create, modify, rename, and upload z/OS UNIX files directly to a z/OS mainframe.
- Enabling the ability to view, poll, and download job spool files on the z/OS mainframe.
- Built in support for Zowe CLI `zosmf` compatible profiles by default.
- Support for token-based authentication with the API Mediation Layer to access z/OSMF APIs.

- Create a Zowe Explorer profile.

## Getting started

This section includes steps for the tasks you need to complete to get started using Zowe Explorer.

Configure Zowe Explorer, create a [team configuration file](#create-a-team-configuration-file) for profile management, review the [sample use cases](#sample-use-cases) to familiarize yourself with the capabilities of Zowe Explorer, and you are ready to use Zowe Explorer.

### Configuring Zowe Explorer

You can configure Zowe Explorer by changing the extension settings. For more information, see [Configuring Zowe Explorer](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/ze-install#configuring-zowe-explorer).

When environment conditions do not support the Zowe CLI built-in Credential Manager, see [Modifying the Secure Credentials Enabled Setting](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/ze-install#modifying-the-secure-credentials-enabled-setting).

### Multifactor authentication support (MFA)

Zowe Explorer supports the use of MFA tokens for authentication. When using zOSMF profiles it is required to connect through the Zowe API Mediation Layer (API ML). Suggested use case for MFA authentication using Zowe Explorer is by logging into the API ML via the right-click login action in Zowe Explorer and when prompted for password enter the MFA token in place of user password, the API will return a JSON token (JWT) that will be used for further authentication.

You can find more information regarding MFA support in Zowe's documentation on [integrating with API Mediation Layer](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/cli-using-integrating-apiml/).

### Create a team configuration file

1. Navigate to the **Side Bar**.
1. Hover over **DATA SETS**, **USS**, or **JOBS**.
1. Click the **+** icon.
1. Select **Create a New Team Configuration File**.
1. If no workspace is open, a global configuration file is created. If a workspace is open, chose either a global configuration file or a project-level configuration file.
1. Edit the config file to include the host and other connection information, and save.

Your team configuration file appears either in your .zowe folder if you chose the global configuration file option, or in your workspace directory if you chose the project-level configuration file option. The notification message that shows in VS Code after config file creation includes the path of the created file.

You can now use all the functionalities of the extension.

### Using profiles for the first time

The first time profiles are used you will be prompted for user name and password for the profile's connection. The term password is used loosely to represent all supported authentication secrets like passphrases, passtickets, Multifactor Authentication (MFA) tokens, etc.

### Updating securely stored credentials

Secure fields in the team configuration file are handled by the Zowe Imperative dependency. To update securely stored user names and passwords in Zowe Explorer, the user can right click the profile and select **Manage Profile**, then **Update Credentials** from the drop down list. This prompts the user for the new credentials and the secure credentials vault is updated.

### Editing team configuration file

1. Navigate to the **Side Bar**.
1. Hover over **DATA SETS**, **USS**, or **JOBS**.
1. Click the **+** icon.
1. If team configuration file is in place, the **Edit Team Configuration File** option displays.
   ![Edit Team Configuration File](/docs/images/ZE-edit-config.png)
   <br /><br />
1. If only a global or project level config is in place, it opens to be edited. If both a global and project level config are in place, the user must select which file to edit.
   ![Edit Config Location Option](/docs/images/ZE-edit-options.png)
   <br /><br />

### Profile validation

Zowe Explorer includes the profile validation feature that helps to ensure that the specified connection to z/OS is successfully established and your profile is ready for use. If the API connection is valid, the profile is active and can be used.

By default, this feature is automatically enabled. You can disable the feature by right-clicking on your profile and selecting the **Disable Validation for Profile** option. Alternatively, you can enable or disable the feature for all profiles in the VS Code settings

1. In VS Code, navigate to **Settings**.
1. Navigate to Zowe Explorer settings.
1. Check the **Automatic Profile Validation** checkbox to enable the automatic validation of profiles option. Uncheck to disable.
1. Restart VS Code.

### Use base profile and token with existing profiles

As a Zowe user, you can leverage the base profile functionality to access multiple services through Single Sign-on. Base profiles enable you to authenticate using the Zowe API Mediation Layer (API ML). You can use base profiles with more than one service profile. For more information, see [Base Profiles](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/cli-using-using-profiles/#base-profiles).

Zowe Explorer has a right click action for profiles to log in and log out of the authentication service for existing base profiles.

1. Open VS Code and select the **Zowe Explorer** icon in the **Side Bar**.
1. Hover over **DATA SETS**, **USS**, or **JOBS**.
1. Click the **+** icon.
1. Select the profile you use with your base profile for token authentication. The profile will appear in the tree.
1. Right-click the profile and select **Manage Profile**.
1. Select the **Log in to Authentication Service** option from the drop down list, then enter basic credentials to request the token. If the request is successful, the token will be used for authentication until the logout action is taken or the token expires.

For more information, see [Integrating with API Mediation Layer](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/cli-using-integrating-apiml).

If you do not want to store your token, you can request the server to end your session token. Use the **Log out from Authentication Service** feature to invalidate the token:

1. Open Zowe Explorer.
1. Hover over **DATA SETS**, **USS**, or **JOBS**.
1. Click the **+** icon.
1. Right-click your profile and select **Manage Profile**.
1. Select the **Log out from Authentication Service** option.

Your token has been successfully invalidated.

## Usage tips

- Use the **Add to Favorite** feature to permanently store chosen data sets, USS files, and jobs in the **Favorites** folder. Right-click on a data set, USS file or jobs and select **Add Favorite**.

- **Syntax Highlighting:** Zowe Explorer supports syntax highlighting for data sets. You can search for and install such extensions in VS Code Marketplace.

- **Update or delete a profile**: Right-click a profile, select the **Manage Profile** option then select **Edit Profile** option from drop down list. This opens the `zowe.config.json` file for the user to modify properties in the profile or delete it.

- **Hide a profile**: You can hide a profile from the profile tree by right-clicking the profile and selecting the **Manage Profile** and then select **Hide Profile** option from the drop down menu. Finally, if the profile is in multiple trees, choose whether the to hide from all trees or just the tree the action was started in. To unhide the profile, click the **+** button and select the profile from the quick pick list.

- **Open recent members**: Zowe Explorer lets you open a list of members you worked on earlier. You can access the list by pressing `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`R` (Windows) or `Command`+`Option`+`R` (Mac).

- **Insert/overtype modes**: Visual Studio Code v1.96 introduced the ability to toggle between insert and overtype modes by pressing the `Insert` key. Overtype mode can be helpful when working with data sets and members with fixed record lengths.

For the comprehensive Zowe Explorer documentation that also includes information about USS and Jobs interactions, see [the Zowe Explorer documentation](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/ze-install.html) in Zowe Docs.

## Extending Zowe Explorer

You can add new functionalities to Zowe Explorer by creating your own extension. For more information, see [Extensions for Zowe Explorer](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/blob/main/docs/README-Extending.md).

**Tip:** View an example of a Zowe Explorer extension: [Zowe Explorer FTP extension documentation](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode#available-documentation).

## Known Issues

### Bidirectional languages

Files written in languages primarily read from right to left (Arabic, Hebrew, many Asian languages) can include portions of text that are written and read left to right, such as numbers.

These bidirectional (BiDi) languages are not currently supported in Visual Studio Code. (See [Issue #86667](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/86667) for more information.)

As a result, VS Code extensions like Zowe Explorer, Zowe Explorer CICS Extension, and Zowe Explorer FTP Extension are not able to support BiDi languages in files.
